# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.


# For the Dev

run `npx hardhat run scripts/mint.js --network coreTestnet` to mint the nft on core testnet

the nfts were minted separately so confirm the ipfshash before minting
